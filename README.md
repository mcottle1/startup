--Modification for GitHub assignment

--Second modification for GitHub assignment

--Merge conflict resolution

What I learned:\n
-Always commit

-Use descriptive commit messages to differentiate between different merges

-Check commit graph of GitLense to see branches and to help resolve merge conflicts

-to run your own git commands, do it from the terminal at the bottom of the page

-commit, push, pull commands are under source control

-git and GitHub is super powerful, keep that in mind and use it carefully but thuroughly 
Ways to clone:
-in terminal: git clone url
-in vs code: cmd + shift +p, search gitcl and select git clone and enter url
-Don't forget the commit message on the left in vs code!
-read up and better understand the different git commands and how to use git from the terminal
Vim:
-vim is a console based code editor
-its based exclusively in keyboard commands
-command state(begining state, can only use commands)
-insert state(type i to enter insert mode, used to actually type and edit code)
