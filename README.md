# Startup

## Github Assignment
--Modification for GitHub assignment

--Second modification for GitHub assignment

--Merge conflict resolution

#### What I learned:

-Always commit

-Use descriptive commit messages to differentiate between different merges

-Check commit graph of GitLense to see branches and to help resolve merge conflicts

-to run your own git commands, do it from the terminal at the bottom of the page

-commit, push, pull commands are under source control

-git and GitHub is super powerful, keep that in mind and use it carefully but thuroughly 

#### Ways to clone:

-in terminal: git clone url

-in vs code: cmd + shift +p, search gitcl and select git clone and enter url

-Don't forget the commit message on the left in vs code!

-read up and better understand the different git commands and how to use git from the terminal

#### Vim:

-vim is a console based code editor

-its based exclusively in keyboard commands

-command state(begining state, can only use commands)

-insert state(type i to enter insert mode, used to actually type and edit code)

#### Creating an AWS server and connecting to it

-Used EC2 in AWS

-My server public IP address 3.16.6.15

-command to shell into server ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[ip address]

-to verify instance type http://3.16.6.15 into search engine

-aws services is the leader in the field of web services

#### Registering a Domain Name

-Used Route 53 in AWS

-Remeber to watch for reupping domain name

-Name and corresponding IP addresses are saved in DNS

-Remeber to set up root and wildcard record types so that it can be accessed using https:// infront of domain name

#### Configuring Caddy to encrypt using HTTP

-HTTP on-secure hypertext transport protocol

-HTTPS Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol

-Having a secure connection means that all the data is encrypted using the TLS protocol

-Web certificates are generated by a trusted 3rd party using public/private key encryption, we use Let's Encrypt

-We set up caddy in ubuntu by modifying the caddyfile

#### HTML Startup

-Modern HTML contains over 100 different elements

-the entire purpose of HTML is to provide content and structure

-HTML defines a header (<!DOCTYPE html>) that tells the browser the type and version of the document. You should always include this at the top of the HTML file

#### Simon HTML

-sup>&reg;<sup/ creates superscript

-Table is used to create the simon image in html also using an svg

-Header, Main, and Footer sections compose each page

-these two meta lines occur at the top of every page

meta charset="UTF-8"/
meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/

-also, don't forget to specify the english language of html at the top of each page

-also dont forget <!DOCTYPE html>

-the -s simon flag on the linux command creates the simon.yourdomainname aspect

#### Simon CSS

- flex and relative positioning
 
  - allows for portrait and landscape orientation on devices
  
  - @media used for flex elements
  
- css selectors that correlate to items in html

- animation using css (great examples on codepen)

- transform and translate elements

- change font and format

- bootstrap in html

  - header
  
  link
      href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
      rel="stylesheet"
      integrity="sha384-Zenh87qX5JnK2Jl0vWa8Ck2rdkQ2Bzep5IDxbcnCeuOxjzrPF/et3URy9Bv1WTRi"
      crossorigin="anonymous"
    /
    
  - can use all sorts of bootstrap elements (carousel, buttons, login page etc.)

### JavaScript

  return operation(a, b);
}

// Anonymous function assigned to a variable
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(doMath(add, 5, 3));
// OUTPUT: 8

  one: 'purple',
  two: 'green',
};
class Fish {
  constructor(one, two){
    this.one = one;
    this.two = two;
  }
    log(){

console.log(fishy.log());

#### What I learned from Start-up HTML and CSS deliverable

- Having access to a live update debugger is incredibly vital

- Understanding padding, margins, and measurements is so important

- Understanding how to center something one of the most important things you can learn

- Flex is a difficult concept that will take practice, so don't take advantage of a website that uses it well

- Unsplash is by far the best place to look for images for a site

- Its better to find images first and build a site and a color pallete around it

- always think about "inheritance" when building css and html

#### Regexs

const regex2 = /\w+/g;

const string = "Hello my name is Mackenzie Cottle";

const findArray2 = string.match(regex2);

- returns an array containing each word as an element

console.log(findArray2);

const isPhoneNumber = /\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}/g

const phoneNumber = "801-234-5678";

const notANumber = "8012345678";

- verifies phone number syntax

#### Rest and Spread

- Rest
- use ... before last parameter and you can list as many parameters as you want and they will be put into an array
- Spread
- use ... infront of parameter that you pass as an array and it will break it down into the functions parameters

function findMyName(name, ...listOfStrings){
  return listOfStrings.some((i) => i.includes(name));
}

console.log(findMyName("Mackenzie", "Hello my name is Joe", "Hello my name is Jeff", "Hello my name is Mackenzie", "Hello my name is David"));

- Example of Rest

function multiplyThree(x,y,z){
  return x * y * z;
}

const numbers = [1,2,3];

console.log(multiplyThree(...numbers));

- Example of spread

#### Destructuring

- a unique way to access array and object elements, can incorporate rest as well into destructuring
- Array destructuring

const destructuring = ["Mackenzie", "Grace", "Cottle"];

const [firstname, middlename, lastname] = destructuring;

- Object destructuring

const person = {fname: 'Jocelyn', mname: 'Elise', lname: 'Carter'};

const {fname, lname} = person;

#### Exceptions

-Try, catch, finally block

try{
  isMyyyyName("Mackenzie");
}catch(err){
  console.log("Error with name guess");
}finally{
  console.log("Guess again");
}

-Fallback

function getScores() {
  try {
    const scores = scoringService.getScores();
    // store the scores so that we can use them later if the network is not available
    window.localStorage.setItem('scores', scores);
    return scores;
  } catch {
    return window.localStorage.getItem('scores');
  }
}

#### DOM

function addRow() {
      let table = document.getElementById("habitStack");
      let row = document.createElement("tr")
      let cell1 = document.createElement("td")
      let cell2 = document.createElement("td")
      cell2.setAttribute("class", "center");
      let cell3 = document.createElement("td")
      let input = document.createElement("input");
      cell1.innerHTML = '<input type="text" id="text" name="varText" placeholder="text here" spellcheck required pattern="[Aa].*" />';
      row.appendChild(cell1);
      cell2.innerHTML = '<label for="time">Time: </label><input type="time" name="varTime" id="time" />';
      row.appendChild(cell2);
      cell3.innerHTML = '<input type="checkbox" id="task1" name="task1" value="task"><label for="task1"> Done for the day!</label>';
      row.appendChild(cell3);
      table.appendChild(row);
   }

function removeRow(){
  let table = document.getElementById("habitStackTable");
  var lastRow = table.rows.length - 1;
  if(lastRow > 1){
    table.deleteRow(lastRow);
  }
}

#### Promise

const pickRandomNumber = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.1) {
      resolve(Math.random() < 0.2 ? '0' : (Math.random() < 0.3 ? '1' : (Math.random() < 0.4 ? '2' : (Math.random() < 0.5 ? '3' : '4'))));
    } else {
      reject('no number for you');
    }
  }, 10000);
});

pickRandomNumber
  .then((result) => console.log(`Random number 0-4: ${result}`))
  .catch((err) => console.log(`Error: ${err}`))
  .finally(() => console.log('Guess completed:)'));
  
#### Async/Await

function pickRandomNumber() {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.1) {
      resolve(Math.random() < 0.2 ? '0' : (Math.random() < 0.3 ? '1' : (Math.random() < 0.4 ? '2' : (Math.random() < 0.5 ? '3' : '4'))));
    } else {
      reject('no number for you');
    }
  }, 50);
});
}

async function randNum()
{
  try{
    const response1 = await pickRandomNumber();
    const response2 = await pass(response1);
  }catch(response1){
    const response3 = await fail(response1);
  }
}

function pass(result){
  console.log(`Random number 0-4: ${result}`);
  console.log('Guess completed:)');
};

function fail(err){
  console.log(`Error: ${err}`);
  console.log('Guess completed:)');
};

#### Simon Javascript

- Don't forget the script lines
- script lines can go at the top of the page when no html is being edited, otherwise it needs to go bellow body and footer

<img width="860" alt="Screenshot 2023-02-24 at 4 16 59 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90581594/221319349-14506fe4-f0f1-4651-9687-148a1cc715ba.png">

#### Notes from Midterm Review

- HTML div creates a division element

- CNAME points one DNS record to another DNS record

- CNAME is an alias, a pointer to another record

- A record points to an IP address

- You CAN use CSS to load fonts from Google

- Look up this syntax

- Get Code from the promise question

- burger fries taco shake noodles

- If you want the catch to be called then you would reject instead of resolve or throw an exception

- Valid JSON {"x":3}

- div.header { color: blue; }

- invalid to say <javascript> some stuff

- Can say <div onclick = 1+1

- /A|f/i i means case insensitive, so anything with an a ro an f will work 

- function f(x) = {} not valid function syntax

- function f(x) {}

- const f = function(x) {}

- const f = (x) => {}

- all valid

- padding puts space around the content of the selected element

- pals before marriage- padding, border, marriage

- content, padding, border, margin

- .join joins all elements together

- reduce, map, sum ect

- html tag for unordered list ul

- document.querySelector('p').Addeventlistener('mouseover', console.log);

- adds a mouseover event listener to a p element

- valid hyperlinks use a element tags and href

- src is for image tags

- ASYNC await vs promise: promise means other code will run, async await means all code that runs after will be delayed ie all other code waits for the waiat call to be resolved

- Rejected throws exception

- If you omit the await, it won't await

- DOM textContext sets the cild text for an element

- DNS subdomain cs260.cs.byu.edu the whole thing is the subdomain

- Column-reverse flips the column completely upside down

- Two things in two seperate p blocks will appear on two seperate elements

- {n:1} javaScript object

- console commans that makes a script executable chmod +x deploy.sh

- ls -la deploy.sh writes to standard output the contents of each specified Directory or the name of each specified File

- sudo deploy.sh lets us use our account and password to execute system commands with root privileges

- ssh deploy.sh provides a secure encrypted connection between two hosts over an insecure network. This connection can also be used for terminal access, file transfers, and for tunneling other applications

#### What I learned from Startup Javascript deliverable

- How to work with local storage to save and repopulate data elsewhere on the site

- The importance of where and how you call your functions in javascript, and the flexibility that this creates

- the difference between querySelector, getElementByID, and querySelectorAll

- How important it is to understand the dom and how powerful it can be

- The importance of HOW you store your information into variables so that it can be accessed across your javascript but also within and across specific functions (ie the checkboxes debacle

#### URL

Uniform resource locator

| Part        | Example                              | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| Scheme      | https                                | The protocol required to ask for the resource. For web applications, this is usually HTTPS. But it could be any internet protocol such as FTP or MAILTO.                                                                                                                            |
| Domain name | byu.edu                              | The domain name that owns the resource represented by the URL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Port        | 3000                                 | The port specifies the numbered network port used to connect to the domain server. Lower number ports are reserved for common internet protocols, higher number ports can be used for any purpose. The default port is 80 if the scheme is HTTP, or 443 if the scheme is HTTPS.     |
| Path        | /school/byu/user/8014                | The path to the resource on the domain. The resource does not have to physically be located on the file system with this path. It can be a logical path representing endpoint parameters, a database table, or an object schema.                                                    |
| Parameters  | filter=names&highlight=intro,summary | The parameters represent a list of key value pairs. Usually it provides additional qualifiers on the resource represented by the path. This might be a filter on the returned resource or how to highlight the resource. The parameters are also sometimes called the query string. |
| Anchor      | summary                              | The anchor usually represents an sub-location in the resource. For HTML pages this represents a request for the browser to automatically scroll to the element with an ID that matches the anchor. The anchor is also sometimes called the hash, or fragment ID.                    |

### Habit Stacker

#### Design

Have you ever heard of habit stacking? Habit stacking is a revolutionary way to create and maintain habits: a notoriously difficult task. Habit stacking relies on the "stacking" new habits on habits that already exist in order to help the individual to remember to do them! For example, a habit stack might include stacking drinking a glass of water on top of brushing your teeth. You might commit to the statement "After brushing my teeth, I will drink a glass of water." Voila! A habit stack! The Habit Stacker application makes this process easy by allowing users to input their current habits as well as the habits that they would like to create and generating a habit stack for them that can be printed off or checked off within the application as tasks are completed each day! Habit stacks and progress can be shared in real time among users to generate community motivation to create and stick to new habits!
